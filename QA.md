## Hints

### How to set up a clean environemnt? <a href="#user-content-01" id="01">üîó</a>

**Safe method**: use a temporary user account on your computer.

  - on macOS:
    - if you are **not** using FileVault, switch to the "Guest User". You may
      have to enable this in "System Preferences -> Users & Groups".  When
      you're done, all data will be removed automatically.
    - if you **are** using FileVault, create a new user in "System
      Preferences -> Users & Groups". When you're done, you'll need to remove
      this user manually.
  - on Linux:
    - create a new user with `sudo useradd -m qa`, and log into that account.
      When you're done, remove the user with `sudo userdel -r qa`.  _Note:
      "qa" is just an example user name, you can choose anything you like_

**Dangerous method**: remove all directories manually.

You can use [this script][rs]. Make sure you have a backup of your data,
or are using this in combination with the safe method (i.e. while logged
in with a temporary user account).
