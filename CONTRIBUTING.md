## Learn more about Upstream

To familiarise yourself with the Upstream app and the Radicle ecosystem, have a
look at the following resources:

- [DEVELOPMENT.md][dmd]
- [Discord][dc]
- [radicle.xyz][ra]
- [Radicle documentation][rd]

## Your first bugfix

If you have found a bug or see an [issue][oi] you'd like to fix, we are keen on
receiving a contribution from you.

We are currently accepting [PR's through GitHub][pr] while we make our own
infrastructure more robust. If it's your first time using GitHub Pull Requests,
learn more about it [here][ghf].

We also accept contributions through [Upstream Patches][up] -- our first version
of Pull Requests in Upstream. Learn more about the contribution flow
[here][cbf]. For us to see you've contributed a Patch, we need to [add your
Device ID as a remote][ar] to our repo. You can either add it to the [Remotes to
track issue][rtr] or post it in [#upstream on Discord][dc-up].

## Documentation

We're writing documentation as we are developing new features. If you find
something that is confusing or not covered at all, feel free to [open a bug][ob]
or [contribute][cd]
