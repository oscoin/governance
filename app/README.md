# MVP

This is a cross-platform desktop app for product explorations.


## Development

The app is written in ReasonML + Electron. For our dependency management and
script execution we use `yarn`.

Code formatting is dictated by `refmt` which is part of [reason-cli][0] and we
enforce it locally on `precommit` with [husky][1] and [lint-staged][2].


### Setup

Run the app locally with hot reloading:

1. Get the code: `git clone git@github.com:oscoin/mvp.git`
2. Install dependencies: `cd mvp/app && yarn install`
3. Start the app in development mode: `yarn start`


Build and package the app:

1. Build: `yarn dist`
2. Get the generated package from: `dist/oscoin-mvp-0.1.0.dmg`


After making changes to the code, run tests:

- Run `yarn test` to have all tests executed
- To have a continuous feedback from our test runner run `yarn test:watch`


### Build pipelines

The app consists of three parts:
  - the main electron process: `src/main`
  - the app logic: `src/renderer`
  - backend GraphQL proxy that runs as a background daemon


#### In development

When you run `yarn start` the following things happen which enable live code
reloading in development mode:

1. Old BuckleScript build outputs in `lib/js` are removed

2. BuckleScript watches code changes and re-compiles ReasonML to JavaScript,
   output lands in `lib/js`

3. When everything in `src/renderer` is compiled we start a webpack development
   webserver which bundles everything from `lib/js/src/renderer/Index.bs.js`
   and serves it together with `assets` on: http://localhost:8000

4. Backend proxy is started and serves mock data via GraphQL on
   http://localhost:8080

5. When both the webserver and proxy are up and running Electron is started.
   Electron gets its configuration from `package.json`, the main Node.js process
   entry point is defined as: `"main": "./lib/js/src/main/Electron.bs.js"`


#### Distributed as a package

We use [electron-builder][3] to build and distribute cross-platform
(macOS/Linux) packages.


1. Old `dist` directory is removed and a new clean one is re-created

2. Old BuckleScript build outputs in `lib/js` are removed

3. BuckleScript compiles all ReasonML source from `src` into `lib/src/js`, this
   includes both code for main process as well as the renderer.

4. Webpack creates a single `.js` bundle file of the renderer sources and
   copies it into the `build` folder together with everything from the `assets`
   folder. This is configured in `webpack.config.js`.

5. The backend proxy is built with cargo and copied into the `dist` folder,
   because all assets have to be in the same folder relative to `package.json`,
   so electron-builder can bundle them into one package.

6. Finally electron-builder packages all the resources into one runnable
   package (including a DMG: `oscoin-mvp-0.1.0.dmg`):

     - renderer from `build/*` -> `oscoin-mvp.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar`
     - main process from `lib/js` -> `oscoin-mvp.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar`
     - proxy from `dist/proxy` -> `oscoin-mvp.app/Contents/Resources/proxy`


##### Runtime details

When the electron app is bundled as a package the setup slightly differs from
development. The app which lives in `src/renderer` is served from an archive
package on the filesystem: `oscoin-mvp.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar`.

If you wanna have a look at the layout of the package, you'll need to extract
it with:

```
npx asar extract app.asar app
ls app
  #  .
  #  ├── build
  #  ├── lib
  #  ├── node_modules
  #  └── package.json
```

The proxy backend is copied by the build pipeline into
`oscoin-mvp.app/Contents/Resources/proxy` and started by the main Node.js
Electron process (`src/main/Electron.re`) when the app is launched.


### Scripts

```
start            - start electron app with hot-code-reloading
dist             - build and package macOS/Linux app

test             - run test suite
test:coverage    - run code coverage
test:watch       - watch changes to source code and continuously re-run tests

webpack:server   - start webpack development server, use the renderer part of
                   the app via your local browser http://localhost:8000/
webpack:build    - build renderer app and copy static assets to build folder

schema:fetch     - fetch GraphQL schema from a running backend proxy
proxy:build      - build the backend GraphQL proxy binary
proxy:start      - start the backend proxy and serve mock data

bs:clean         - clean all `.js` files generated by BuckleScript in `lib/js`
bs:build         - compile ReasonML to Javascript, output to `lib/js`
bs:watch         - continuously watch and re-compile ReasonML code to JS
