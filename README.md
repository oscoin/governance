# What is Upstream?

Upstream is a cross-platform desktop client for the radicle code collaboration
and registry protocols.

At the moment we support Linux and macOS. Later on we'll provide ready-made
packages for both platforms, however for now a good way to explore the project
is to read the documentation and have a go at building it locally.

The [UI][ui] is written in JavaScript using [Svelte][sv] and Electron and the
node [proxy][pr] logic is implemented in [Rust][ru].

A good entry point for exploration is [`DEVELOPMENT.md`][de], where you'll find
information on how to build Upstream from source.

If you have questions or would like to get in touch, check out
[radicle.community][rc].
