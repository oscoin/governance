# Proxy

A background service that implements all business logic tying together the
radicle code collaboration and registry protocols. It provides a GraphQL API to
the UI.

After that the API is served on `http://127.0.0.1:8080/graphql`.

```sh
git submodule update --recursive
```

Then run tests as usual:

```sh
cargo test
```
